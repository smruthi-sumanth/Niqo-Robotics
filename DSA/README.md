# Max Pooling with Brute Force Approach

## Description

Max pooling is a common operation used in convolutional neural networks to downsample feature maps, typically following convolutional layers. The brute-force approach to max pooling involves the following steps:

1. **Padding Calculation:**
   - Compute the necessary padding to adjust the dimensions of the input matrix as required.

2. **Padding Application:**
   - Expand the dimensions of the input matrix by adding padding values around it.

3. **Max Pooling Operation:**
   - Slide a pooling window over the padded matrix with a specified stride.
   - For each position of the window, extract the values and compute the maximum value.
   - Store this maximum value in the output matrix.


## Worst-Case Time Complexity

To analyze the worst-case time complexity, consider the following parameters:

- \( h \): Height of the output matrix.
- \( w \): Width of the output matrix.
- \( p \): Height of the pooling window.
- \( q \): Width of the pooling window.
- \( n \): Height of the input matrix.
- \( m \): Width of the input matrix.

### 1. Padding Calculation

Padding calculation is done in constant time:
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(1)\)

### 2. Padding Application

Padding the matrix involves iterating over every element of the input matrix:
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n \times m)\)

### 3. Max Pooling Operation

For each position of the pooling window, the maximum value is computed:
- For each window position, the time complexity is \(O(p x q)\).
- There are \(h \times w\) such positions in the output matrix.
- **Total Time Complexity for Max Pooling:** \(O(h x w x p x q)\)

### Overall Time Complexity

Combining the padding and max pooling operations:
- **Overall Time Complexity:** \(O(n x m) + O(h x w x p x q)\)

Where:
- \(O(n x m)\) accounts for the padding operation.
- \(O(h x w x p x q)\) accounts for the max pooling operation.

## Conclusion

The brute-force approach to max pooling is simple and effective, but it is inherently limited by its time complexity. Further optimization at the code level is constrained by the need to examine each element within the pooling window. Advanced techniques for optimization may involve parallel processing or hardware acceleration but are beyond the scope of this basic algorithm.
